# Python-CRUV-Project
### Step 1: Analyze dataset
### Step 2: Clean dataset like removing punctuations, stopwords, Uppercase -> Lowercase, created tokens(word)
### Step 3: I chose to use Lemmatization over Stemming as here we need more accurate and meaningfull output.
### Step 4: Used TF-IDF to create Frequency Matrix, TF Matrix, IDF Matrix, TF-IDF Matrix.

## Actually after this I didn't get enough time to complete the project as today i.e. 25/01/2023 was last to submit.
